## UX principles (non-negotiable)
1. Booking must be *one tap away* on every page.
2. Services must be *scannable* (category anchors + clean rows).
3. Trust must be immediate (reviews, hygiene, location clarity).
4. Prices must be consistent and clearly formatted.
5. Everything must be readable on mobile.

## Page-by-page flow
### Home
Hero → categories → signature highlight → featured → testimonials → location → CTA

### Services
Anchor nav → category blocks → each row has “Book this” → consultation CTA

### Contact
Quick actions → map + address → form → policies

### About
Story + hygiene + team (optional) → CTA

## Microcopy standards
- Keep lines short
- Avoid buzzwords
- Use “Book Appointment” consistently
- Use ₹ symbol always
